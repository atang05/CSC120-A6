What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?

This provides me with a new perspective on how to avoid errors and how to throw appropriate exceptions while writing the code because I get to know what the code will be tested on.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

And when thinking about what should be tested, students should think about every aspects. For example, when buying a new computer, the students should first check the number of computers in the inventory, as well as whether the added computer in the inventory matches the information given by the user.
